# Database-Storage-Illusion-v-1.0
This is a python-script made with framework flask :heartpulse: , which performs actions on form inputs received from user and stores it in a ```CSV```file (Comma Separated File), and also reads and retrieve data to display it in html file. All these stuff enables it as a real-time database illusion. It looks like as if we have a real storage of our data somewhere in a real database. To conclude and have an exact User-Interface for data-base we can view the data of csv file in excel sheets, Libre-Office or Google spreadheets etc.

### More on Flask :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:
[Flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)) is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. 

### Well, wanna use my Web-Application :thinking:?, I'm glad :blush:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Prereqisites : Flask & Python-3. If you don't have flask on your system, [get_it](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/).
3. After you're all set-up, just open terminal in the root directory of the project and hit ```flask run```, you'll be provided with a link opened up at ```port-5000```. Copy it to your favorite :hugs: browser or Click the link, you'll be taken to the web-application. Prompt user to enter details then the existing data at ```registered.csv``` will be displayed at the page you'll be redirected when you hit up the submit button.
4. To get a real-time illusion of perfect database, open it up in your favorite spreadsheets.
